 Abstract:
 `ButtonNode` is a custom `SKSpriteNode` that provides button-like behavior in a SpriteKit scene. It is supported by `ButtonNodeResponderType` (a protocol for classes that can respond to button presses) and `ButtonIdentifier` (an enumeration that defines all of the kinds of buttons that are supported in the game).
